# Singly Linked Lists:
A singly linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element points to the next one in the sequence. The basic building block of a singly linked list is a node, which contains two fields:

Data: This field stores the actual data of the node.
Next: This field is a reference (or a link) to the next node in the sequence.
# int data: This is where you store the actual data of the node.
struct Node* next: This is a pointer to the next node in the sequence.
To create a linked list, you start with a head pointer that points to the first node. The last node in the list points to NULL, indicating the end of the list.

Operations on a singly linked list include:

Insertion: Adding a new node.
Deletion: Removing a node.
Traversal: Visiting each node one by one.
Searching: Finding a specific node based on its data.
