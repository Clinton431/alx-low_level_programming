# 0x14. C - Bit manipulation
Bit manipulation in C programming involves manipulating individual bits of binary representations of data. It's a technique that allows you to perform operations at the bitwise level, providing a way to efficiently perform certain tasks such as setting, clearing, or toggling specific bits, extracting or inserting specific bits, and checking the status of individual bits.
